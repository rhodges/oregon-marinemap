<h3>Excluding Federal Waters</h3>
<p>Your geometry has been clipped to remove any portion outside of the territorial sealine. Remaining portions within state waters, estuaries, and terrestrial areas have been preserved.</p>
<p>If you ever need to change your shape, we also keep a copy of the lines you draw, so you will always have the un-clipped version for editing.</p>
