<h3>Geometry Clipping</h3>
<img src="{{MEDIA_URL}}manipulators/clipping.gif" width="369" height="88" />
<p>Your geometry has been clipped to remove any portion outside of the territorial sealine. Portions within state waters, estuaries, and terrestrial areas have been preserved.</p>
<p>If you ever need to change your shape, we also keep a copy of the lines you draw, so you will always have the un-clipped version for editing.</p>
