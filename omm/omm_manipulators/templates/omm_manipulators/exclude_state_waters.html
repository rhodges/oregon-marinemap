<h3>Excluding State Waters</h3>
<p>Your geometry has been clipped to remove any portion that is within state waters. Either the remaining portion in federal waters or the remaining terrestrial portion has been preserved (depending on whichever was larger).</p>
<p>If you ever need to change your shape, we also keep a copy of the lines you draw, so you will always have the un-clipped version for editing.</p>
